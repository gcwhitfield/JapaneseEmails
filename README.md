# JapaneseEmails

  This is a service that will send users daily Japanese vocabulary words for the JLPT N3 and N4 tests. I made it as a       
  programming project for myself.

## How to add people to the email list

  Go into contacts.txt and, on a newline, write this:
  '{person-name} {person-email-address}'

  Example:
  Martha marthaperson@gmail.com
